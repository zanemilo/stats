# Stats

Welcome to the **Stats** repository!

This project is dedicated to learning, implementing, and documenting statistical methods in Python. Here, you'll find a collection of scripts, examples, and workflows for various statistical techniques, as well as tools for processing real-world data and visualizing results.

## Project Goals

- **Learn and apply statistical methods** using Python.
- **Document workflows** for different types of statistical analyses.
- **Reference and explain** the reasoning behind each statistical method used.
- **Define key statistical terms** relevant to each script or module.
- **Visualize data and results** to aid understanding.

## Planned Structure

- `examples/` — Example scripts demonstrating specific statistical methods.
- `data/` — Sample datasets for analysis.
- `workflows/` — Step-by-step guides for common statistical tasks.
- `definitions.md` — Glossary of statistical terms used in the repo.
- `plots/` — Output visualizations from analyses.

## Getting Started

This repository is a work in progress. As it develops, you'll find:

- Python scripts for descriptive and inferential statistics
- Data processing and cleaning examples
- Explanations of statistical concepts and when to use them
- Visualizations to illustrate statistical findings
