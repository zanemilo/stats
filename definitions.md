| **Data**         | Collected values or measurements for variables.                                               |
| **Parameter**    | A summary value describing a population (e.g., population mean).                              |
| **Statistic**    | A summary value calculated from a sample (e.g., sample mean).                                 |
| **Mean**         | The average value (sum of values ÷ number of values).                                         |
| **Median**       | The middle value when data is ordered.                                                        |
| **Mode**         | The most frequently occurring value(s).                                                       |
| **Range**        | Difference between the largest and smallest values.                                           |
| **Variance**     | The average squared difference from the mean.                                                 |
| **Standard Deviation** | The square root of the variance; shows typical deviation from the mean.                 |

## Intermediate Concepts

| **Term**                | **Definition**                                                                                  |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Probability Distribution** | Describes probabilities of all possible outcomes for a variable.                        |
| **Normal Distribution**      | Symmetric, bell-shaped distribution defined by mean & standard deviation.                |
| **Hypothesis Testing**       | Procedure for making inferences about populations using sample data.                     |
| **Null Hypothesis (H₀)**    | Assumes no effect or difference exists.                                                  |
| **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)** | Contradicts H₀; suggests an effect or difference.                                 |
| **p-value**                 | Probability of observing results as extreme as those measured, assuming H₀ is true.       |
| **Confidence Interval**     | Range likely to contain the true population parameter.                                    |
| **Correlation**             | Measures strength & direction of a linear relationship between two variables.             |
| **Regression Analysis**     | Models relationships between dependent & independent variables.                           |
| **ANOVA**                   | Compares means of three or more groups.                                                   |

| **Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)** | Finds parameter values that make observed data most probable.                 |
| **Nonparametric Methods**    | Do not assume a specific data distribution.                                                |
| **Time Series Analysis**     | Analyzes data collected over time to find trends/patterns.                                 |
| **Monte Carlo Simulation**   | Uses random sampling to estimate outcomes of complex systems.                              |
| **Bootstrap Methods**        | Resamples data to estimate the distribution of a statistic.                                |
| **Multicollinearity**        | When independent variables in regression are highly correlated.                            |
| **Heteroscedasticity**       | When error variance changes across levels of an independent variable in regression.         |
